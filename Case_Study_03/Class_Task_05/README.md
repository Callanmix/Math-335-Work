Notes for the Reading

Chapter 6:
Use the Editor instead of the console to work in R to be able to save your work.

Chapter 11:
Our goal is to turn files into data frames. 
skip = n to skip lines in a read_csv() file
read_csv() is faster and keeps characters as characters compared to read.csv()
tibble-- tiny table = gives table information when printed
comment = # to skip any comments in the file
#  \n is to do a new line of data
na = to show a value is missing from the original data set.

Use parse_number() to seperate a number from other markers $ % ect
When actually Parsing, you can use function guess_parse to help you make the right choice.

scale_x_continuous()
